The Best-Performing Student Recognition System aims to identify and honor the top-performing students in a college by evaluating their academic achievements, consistency over semesters, participation in extracurricular activities (such as hackathons and paper presentations), and contributions to the academic community (like assisting faculty). The system uses a dynamic, data-driven approach to rank students fairly, applying machine learning techniques to adjust the importance of various performance factors over time. 
Its goal is to provide an objective, transparent, and scalable platform for recognizing student excellence, fostering a competitive and motivational environment.
